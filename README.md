# Pizza Sales Data Analysis and Dashboard Creation



In this project, I developed an interactive dashboard using Power BI to analyze pizza sales data. The project involved several key components:

Data Import and Preparation: Imported raw sales data from a CSV file into MS SQL Server, ensuring proper data types and structure for analysis.

SQL Querying: Wrote complex SQL queries to calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total revenue, average order value, and sales percentages by pizza category and size.

Dashboard Design: Created multiple dashboards, including a home dashboard and a detailed analysis of best and worst-selling pizzas. Implemented slicers for dynamic filtering by date ranges and pizza categories.

Data Visualization: Utilized various chart types (bar charts, KPI cards, etc.) to visualize sales trends, top-selling pizzas, and performance metrics. Applied conditional formatting to enhance visual appeal and clarity.

User Interaction: Integrated navigation buttons to allow users to switch between dashboards seamlessly, improving user experience.

Insights and Recommendations: Analyzed sales data to identify trends and provide actionable insights
